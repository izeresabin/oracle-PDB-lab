### Note:
PDBs created in Tasks 1 & 2 were verified using SQL Developer queries. 
EM Express (lightweight version) has limited container display functionality 
in Oracle XE edition.

## Challenges and Solutions
- Any issues you faced and how you resolved them: I had to install new version of oracle inorder to get PDB Features.
